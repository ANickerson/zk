# `zk` – a plain text note-taking assistant

Looking for a quick usage example? [Let's get started](getting-started.md).

`zk` is a command-line tool helping you to maintain a plain text [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) or [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki).

It is primarily focused on:

* [keeping your notebook future-proof](future-proof.md), by relying on plain text
* [creating notes from templates](note-creation.md)
* performing [advanced search queries](note-filtering.md)
* being a hub for everything related to your notes, thanks to [command aliases](config-alias.md) and [automation](automation.md).
* [notebook housekeeping](notebook-housekeeping.md)

What `zk` is not:

* a note editor
* a tool to serve your notes on the web – for this, you may be interested in [Neuron](neuron.md) or [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum).
